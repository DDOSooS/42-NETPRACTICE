## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Complete 10 levels of networking exercises
- **Skills**: TCP/IP addressing, network configuration, troubleshooting
- **Tools**: Web-based training interface

## Fundamental Concepts

1. **IP Addressing**: Understanding IPv4 address structure and subnetting
2. **Subnet Masks**: How they define network and host portions of an IP address
3. **Routing**: Basic principles of routing between networks
4. **Network Devices**: Configuring routers, switches, and end devices
5. **TCP/IP**: The foundational protocols for internet communication

## Getting Started

1. Download the project files from the provided source
2. Extract the files to your preferred directory
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to access the training interface

## Training Interface

- Enter your login to access personalized practice
- 10 levels of increasing difficulty
- Each level presents a non-functioning network diagram
- Modify unshaded fields to correct the network configuration
- Use "Check again" to verify your solution
- Use "Get my config" to download your configuration for submission

## Project Completion

- Successfully complete all 10 levels
- Download the configuration for each level using "Get my config"
- Place the 10 configuration files in the root of your Git repository

## Tips for Success

- Thoroughly understand TCP/IP addressing before starting
- Pay attention to subnet masks and their effects on network ranges
- Use the logs at the bottom of the interface for troubleshooting
- Practice regularly to improve your speed and accuracy

## Resources

- [TCP/IP Addressing Guide](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3588315/what-is-an-ip-address-and-what-is-your-ip-address.html)
